    <h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>

    <p>
      St端ssy is committed to digital accessibility and to conforming to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
      2.1, Level A and AA, and complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) effective communication
      requirements, and other applicable regulations.
    </p>

    <p>
      To accomplish this, we have partnered with eSSENTIAL Accessibility to administer our accessibility program and
      oversee its governance. Their accessibility program evaluates our digital products on an ongoing basis in
      accordance with best practices and is supported by a diverse team of accessibility professionals, including users
      of assistive technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform, moreover, goes beyond minimum compliance requirements by making an assistive CX technology
      application available to customers who have trouble typing, gesturing, moving a mouse, or reading. The application
      is free to download, and it incorporates tools such as mouse and keyboard replacements, voice recognition, speech
      enablement, hands-free/touch-free navigation, and more.
    </p>

    <p>We want to hear from you if you encounter any accessibility barriers on our digital properties.</p>
